## 📊 Key Analysis Performed

### 1️⃣ Data Loading & Understanding

* Loaded Superstore dataset using Pandas
* Inspected dataset structure using .info() and .describe()
* Checked column names, data types, and missing values

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning

* Filled or handled **null values**
* Removed inconsistencies where required
* Prepared clean data for analysis

### 3️⃣ Sales Analysis

* Total and average sales calculation
* Sales distribution across:

  * **Product Categories**
  * **Sub-Categories**
  * **Customer Segments**

### 4️⃣ Customer Segment Analysis

* Compared sales contribution by:

  * Consumer
  * Corporate
  * Home Office
* Visualized using **pie charts** and **bar plots**

### 5️⃣ Category & Sub-Category Insights

* Identified **top-performing** and **low-performing** categories
* Horizontal bar charts for clear comparison

### 6️⃣ Profit Trend Analysis

* Analyzed overall **business performance**
* Determined whether the store is running in **profit or loss**
* Trend-based visualizations for better decision-making
